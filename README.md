  # The Rise and Fall of Cryptocurrencies
A seminar paper on the topic of the rise and fall of cryptocurrencies. 

This paper originated from my seminar work in the summer semester 2020 at the University of AppliedSciences  Wedel,  which  was  supervised  by Prof. Dr. Beuster. This paper is about cryptocurrenciesand the different aspects under which these can be assessed. It is based on the same-titled paper by Federet al.
